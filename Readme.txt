Carbon Footprint Calculator
This Python script helps calculate and visualize the carbon footprint of a business or individual. It uses data such as energy consumption, waste generation, and business travel to provide estimations of CO2 emissions.

Features
Data Input: The script prompts the user for input on various parameters like electricity, gas, fuel bills, waste generation, recycling percentage, travel distance, and fuel efficiency.
Carbon Footprint Calculation: It uses the calc module to calculate the carbon footprint for each input based on pre-defined formulas.
Suggestions: The suggestions module provides personalized recommendations for reducing carbon emissions based on the calculated footprint.
Data Visualization: The script uses the data_visualization module to generate:
Pie Charts: Visualize the breakdown of carbon footprint for each entry.
Total Carbon Footprint: Show the total carbon footprint for all entries.
Carbon Footprint by Entry: Display the carbon footprint for each entry individually.
PDF Report: The report module generates a PDF report with detailed data and suggestions.
File Management: The script creates a PDF report and stores it in a designated "reports" folder.
Usage
